<h3>User vs Kernel<a class="headerlink" href="#user-vs-kernel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="admonition-user-vs-kernel"></span><p>Kernel and user are two terms that are often used in operating
systems. Their definition is pretty straight forward: The kernel is
the part of the operating system that runs with higher privileges
while user (space) usually means by applications running with low
privileges.</p>
<p>However these terms are heavily overloaded and might have very
specific meanings in some contexts.</p>
<p>User mode and kernel mode are terms that may refer specifically to the
processor execution mode. Code that runs in kernel mode can fully
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#hypervisor" id="id1">[1]</a> control the CPU while code that runs in user mode has
certain limitations. For example, local CPU interrupts can only be
disabled or enabled while running in kernel mode. If such an operation
is attempted while running in user mode an exception will be generated
and the kernel will take over to handle it.</p>

<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>some processors may have even higher privileges than
kernel mode, e.g. a hypervisor mode, that is only
accessible to code running in a hypervisor (virtual
machine monitor)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>User space and kernel space may refer specifically to memory
protection or to virtual address spaces associated with either the
kernel or user applications.</p>
<p>Grossly simplifying, the kernel space is the memory area that is
reserved to the kernel while user space is the memory area reserved to
a particular user process. The kernel space is accessed protected so
that user applications can not access it directly, while user space
can be directly accessed from code running in kernel mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="typical-operating-system-architecture">
<h3>Typical operating system architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#typical-operating-system-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the typical operating system architecture (see the figure below)
the operating system kernel is responsible for access and sharing the
hardware in a secure and fair manner with multiple applications.</p>
<img alt="../_images/ditaa-12614a4afe93c9e1ae68861a79f14afe4f3e4b3e.png" class="admonition-typical-operating-system-architecture" src="../_images/ditaa-12614a4afe93c9e1ae68861a79f14afe4f3e4b3e.png" />
<p>The kernel offers a set of APIs that applications issue which are
generally referred to as “System Calls”. These APIs are different from
regular library APIs because they are the boundary at which the
execution mode switch from user mode to kernel mode.</p>
<p>In order to provide application compatibility, system calls are rarely
changed. Linux particularly enforces this (as opposed to in kernel
APIs that can change as needed).</p>
<p>The kernel code itself can be logically separated in core kernel
code and device drivers code. Device drivers code is responsible of
accessing particular devices while the core kernel code is
generic. The core kernel can be further divided into multiple logical
subsystems (e.g. file access, networking, process management, etc.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monolithic-kernel">
<h3>Monolithic kernel<a class="headerlink" href="#monolithic-kernel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A monolithic kernel is one where there is no access protection between
the various kernel subsystems and where public functions can be
directly called between various subsystems.</p>
<img alt="../_images/ditaa-b80a9008bc3c846632969af516b640297e62e680.png" class="admonition-monolithic-kernel" src="../_images/ditaa-b80a9008bc3c846632969af516b640297e62e680.png" />
<p>However, most monolithic kernels do enforce a logical separation
between subsystems especially between the core kernel and device
drivers with relatively strict APIs (but not necessarily fixed in
stone) that must be used to access services offered by one subsystem
or device drivers. This, of course, depends on the particular kernel
implementation and the kernel’s architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="micro-kernel">
<h3>Micro kernel<a class="headerlink" href="#micro-kernel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A micro-kernel is one where large parts of the kernel are protected
from each-other, usually running as services in user space. Because
significant parts of the kernel are now running in user mode, the
remaining code that runs in kernel mode is significantly smaller, hence
micro-kernel term.</p>
<img alt="../_images/ditaa-5802a7c7d56e7a90c0802cd243a3564024db8d8b.png" class="admonition-micro-kernel" src="../_images/ditaa-5802a7c7d56e7a90c0802cd243a3564024db8d8b.png" />
<p>In a micro-kernel architecture the kernel contains just enough code
that allows for message passing between different running
processes. Practically that means implement the scheduler and an IPC
mechanism in the kernel, as well as basic memory management to setup
the protection between applications and services.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of this architecture is that the services are
isolated and hence bugs in one service won’t impact other services.</p>
<p>As such, if a service crashes we can just restart it without affecting
the whole system. However, in practice this is difficult to achieve
since restarting a service may affect all applications that depend on
that service (e.g. if the file server crashes all applications with
opened file descriptors would encounter errors when accessing them).</p>
<p>This architecture imposes a modular approach to the kernel and offers
memory protection between services but at a cost of performance. What
is a simple function call between two services on monolithic kernels
now requires going through IPC and scheduling which will incur a
performance penalty <a class="footnote-reference" href="#minix-vs-linux" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3>Micro-kernels vs monolithic kernels<a class="headerlink" href="#micro-kernels-vs-monolithic-kernels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Advocates of micro-kernels often suggest that micro-kernel are
superior because of the modular design a micro-kernel
enforces. However, monolithic kernels can also be modular and there
are several approaches that modern monolithic kernels use toward this
goal:</p>
<ul class="admonition-monolithic-kernels-can-be-modular simple">
<li>Components can enabled or disabled at compile time</li>
<li>Support of loadable kernel modules (at runtime)</li>
<li>Organize the kernel in logical, independent subsystems</li>
<li>Strict interfaces but with low performance overhead: macros,
inline functions, function pointers</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a class of operating systems that (used to) claim to be
hybrid kernels, in between monolithic and micro-kernels (e.g. Windows,
Mac OS X). However, since all of the typical monolithic services run
in kernel-mode in these operating systems, there is little merit to
qualify them other then monolithic kernels.</p>
<p class="admonition-hybrid-kernels">Many operating systems and kernel experts have dismissed the label
as meaningless, and just marketing. Linus Torvalds said of this
issue:</p>
<p>“As to the whole ‘hybrid kernel’ thing - it’s just marketing. It’s
‘oh, those microkernels had good PR, how can we try to get good PR
for our working kernel? Oh, I know, let’s use a cool name and try
to imply that it has all the PR advantages that that other system
has’.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="address-space">
<h3>Address space<a class="headerlink" href="#address-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="admonition-address-space"></span><p>The address space term is an overload term that can have different
meanings in different contexts.</p>
<p>The physical address space refers to the way the RAM and device
memories are visible on the memory bus. For example, on 32bit Intel
architecture, it is common to have the RAM mapped into the lower
physical address space while the graphics card memory is mapped high
in the physical address space.</p>
<p>The virtual address space (or sometimes just address space) refers to
the way the CPU sees the memory when the virtual memory module is
activated (sometime called protected mode or paging enabled). The
kernel is responsible of setting up a mapping that creates a virtual
address space in which areas of this space are mapped to certain
physical memory areas.</p>
<p>Related to the virtual address space there are two other terms that
are often used: process (address) space and kernel (address) space.</p>
<p>The process space is (part of) the virtual address space associated
with a process. It is the “memory view” of processes. It is a
continuous area that starts at zero. Where the process’s address space
ends depends on the implementation and architecture.</p>
<p>The kernel space is the “memory view” of the code that runs in kernel
mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-and-kernel-sharing-the-virtual-address-space">
<h3>User and kernel sharing the virtual address space<a class="headerlink" href="#user-and-kernel-sharing-the-virtual-address-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A typical implementation for user and kernel spaces is one where the
virtual address space is shared between user processes and the kernel.</p>
<p>In this case kernel space is located at the top of the address space,
while user space at the bottom. In order to prevent the user processes
from accessing kernel space, the kernel creates mappings that prevent
access to the kernel space from user mode.</p>

<div class="section" id="execution-contexts">
<h3>Execution contexts<a class="headerlink" href="#execution-contexts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="admonition-execution-contexts"></span><p>One of the most important jobs of the kernel is to service interrupts
and to service them efficiently. This is so important that a special
execution context is associated with it.</p>
<p>The kernel executes in interrupt context when it runs as a result of
an interrupt. This includes the interrupt handler, but it is not
limited to it, there are other special (software) constructs that run
in interrupt mode.</p>
<p>Code running in interrupt context always runs in kernel mode and there
are certain limitations that the kernel programmer has to be aware of
(e.g. not calling blocking functions or accessing user space).</p>
<p>Opposed to interrupt context there is process context. Code that runs
in process context can do so in user mode (executing application code)
or in kernel mode (executing a system call).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-tasking">
<h3>Multi-tasking<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-tasking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="admonition-multi-tasking"></span><p>Multitasking is the ability of the operating system to
“simultaneously” execute multiple programs. It does so by quickly
switching between running processes.</p>
<p>Cooperative multitasking requires the programs to cooperate to achieve
multitasking. A program will run and relinquish CPU control back
to the OS, which will then schedule another program.</p>
<p>With preemptive multitasking the kernel will enforce strict limits for
each process, so that all processes have a fair chance of
running. Each process is allowed to run a time slice (e.g. 100ms)
after which, if it is still running, it is forcefully preempted and
another task is scheduled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preemptive-kernel">
<h3>Preemptive kernel<a class="headerlink" href="#preemptive-kernel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p class="admonition-preemptive-kernel">Preemptive multitasking and preemptive kernels are different terms.</p>
<p>A kernel is preemptive if a process can be preempted while running
in kernel mode.</p>
<p>However, note that non-preemptive kernels may support preemptive
multitasking.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pageable-kernel-memory">
<h3>Pageable kernel memory<a class="headerlink" href="#pageable-kernel-memory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p class="admonition-pageable-kernel-memory">A kernel supports pageable kernel memory if parts of kernel memory
(code, data, stack or dynamically allocated memory) can be swapped
to disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kernel-stack">
<h3>Kernel stack<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel-stack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p class="admonition-kernel-stack">Each process has a kernel stack that is used to maintain the
function call chain and local variables state while it is executing
in kernel mode, as a result of a system call.</p>
<p>The kernel stack is small (4KB - 12 KB) so the kernel developer has
to avoid allocating large structures on stack or recursive calls
that are not properly bounded.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="portability">
<h3>Portability<a class="headerlink" href="#portability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to increase portability across various architectures and
hardware configurations, modern kernels are organized as follows at the
top level:</p>
<ul class="admonition-portability simple">
<li>Architecture and machine specific code (C &amp; ASM)</li>
<li>Independent architecture code (C):<ul>
<li>kernel core (further split in multiple subsystems)</li>
<li>device drivers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes it easier to reuse code as much as possible between
different architectures and machine configurations.</p>

<h3>Asymmetric MultiProcessing (ASMP)<a class="headerlink" href="#asymmetric-multiprocessing-asmp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Asymmetric MultiProcessing (ASMP) is a way of supporting multiple
processors (cores) by a kernel, where a processor is dedicated to the
kernel and all other processors run user space programs.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this approach is that the kernel throughput
(e.g. system calls, interrupt handling, etc.) does not scale with the
number of processors and hence typical processes frequently use system
calls. The scalability of the approach is limited to very specific
systems (e.g. scientific applications).</p>

<h3>Symmetric MultiProcessing (SMP)<a class="headerlink" href="#symmetric-multiprocessing-smp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As opposed to ASMP, in SMP mode the kernel can run on any of the
existing processes, just as user processes. This approach is more
difficult to implement, because it creates race conditions in the
kernel if two processes run kernel functions that access the same
memory locations.</p>
<p>In order to support SMP the kernel must implement synchronization
primitives (e.g. spin locks) to guarantee that only one processor is
executing a critical section.</p>

<h3>CPU Scalability<a class="headerlink" href="#cpu-scalability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CPU scalability refers to how well the performance scales with
the number of cores. There are a few things that the kernel developer
should keep in mind with regard to CPU scalability:</p>
<ul class="admonition-cpu-scalability simple">
<li>Use lock free algorithms when possible</li>
<li>Use fine grained locking for high contention areas</li>
<li>Pay attention to algorithm complexity</li>

<h3>Linux development model<a class="headerlink" href="#linux-development-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="admonition-linux-development-model"></span><p>The Linux kernel is one the largest open source projects in the world
with thousands of developers contributing code and millions of lines of
code changed for each release.</p>
<p>It is distributed under the GPLv2 license, which simply put,
requires that any modification of the kernel done on software that is
shipped to customer should be made available to them (the customers),
although in practice most companies make the source code publicly
available.</p>
<p>There are many companies (often competing) that contribute code to the
Linux kernel as well as people from academia and independent
developers.</p>
<p>The current development model is based on doing releases at fixed
intervals of time (usually 3 - 4 months). New features are merged into
the kernel during a one or two week merge window. After the merge
window, a release candidate is done on a weekly basis (rc1, rc2, etc.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="maintainer-hierarchy">
<h3>Maintainer hierarchy<a class="headerlink" href="#maintainer-hierarchy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to scale the development process, Linux uses a hierarchical
maintainership model:</p>
<ul class="admonition-maintainer-hierarchy simple">
<li>Linus Torvalds is the maintainer of the Linux kernel and merges pull
requests from subsystem maintainers</li>
<li>Each subsystem has one or more maintainers that accept patches or
pull requests from developers or device driver maintainers</li>
<li>Each maintainer has its own git tree, e.g.:<ul>
<li>Linux Torvalds: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git</li>
<li>David Miller (networking): git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each subsystem may maintain a -next tree where developers can submit
patches for the next merge window</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the merge window is only a maximum of two weeks, most of the
maintainers have a -next tree where they accept new features from
developers or maintainers downstream while even when the merge window
is closed.</p>
<p>Note that bug fixes are accepted even outside merge window in the
maintainer’s tree from where they are periodically pulled by the
upstream maintainer regularly, for every release candidate.</p>

<h4>Device drivers<a class="headerlink" href="#device-drivers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<span class="admonition-device-drivers"></span><p>The Linux kernel uses a unified device model whose purpose is to
maintain internal data structures that reflect the state and structure
of the system. Such information includes what devices are present,
what is their status, what bus they are attached to, to what driver
they are attached, etc. This information is essential for implementing
system wide power management, as well as device discovery and dynamic
device removal.</p>
<p>Each subsystem has its own specific driver interface that is tailored
to the devices it represents in order to make it easier to write
correct drivers and to reduce code duplication.</p>
<p>Linux supports one of the most diverse set of device drivers type,
some examples are: TTY, serial, SCSI, fileystem, ethernet, USB,
framebuffer, input, sound, etc.</p>

<div class="section" id="process-management">
<h4>Process management<a class="headerlink" href="#process-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<span class="admonition-process-management"></span><p>Linux implements the standard Unix process management APIs such as
fork(), exec(), wait(), as well as standard POSIX threads.</p>
<p>However, Linux processes and threads are implemented particularly
different than other kernels. There are no internal structures
implementing processes or threads, instead there is a <code class="xref c c-type docutils literal"><span class="pre">struct</span>
<span class="pre">task_struct</span></code> that describe an abstract scheduling unit called task.</p>
<p>A task has pointers to resources, such as address space, file
descriptors, IPC ids, etc. The resource pointers for tasks that are
part of the same process point to the same resources, while resources
of tasks of different processes will point to different resources.</p>
<p>This peculiarity, together with the <cite>clone()</cite> and <cite>unshare()</cite> system
call allows for implementing new features such as namespaces.</p>
<p>Namespaces are used together with control groups (cgroup) to implement
operating system virtualization in Linux.</p>
<p>cgroup is a mechanism to organize processes hierarchically and
distribute system resources along the hierarchy in a controlled and
configurable manner.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>inode - describes the file on disk (attributes, location of data
blocks on disk)</li>
<li>dentry - links an inode to a name</li>
<li>file - describes the properties of an opened file (e.g. file
